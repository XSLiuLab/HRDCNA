# HRD~CNA~ model

## Homologous recombination deficiency introduction
Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) renders cancer cells vulnerable to unrepaired double-strand breaks, and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum chemotherapy drugs have demonstrated clinical efficacy in HRD patients. Clinically, it remains a challenge to predict HRD precisely with a fair medical price. Copy number alteration (CNA) information can be obtained from a diverse type of data, such as shallow WGS, WES, SNP array, and panel sequencing, and could represent a cost-effective type of biomarker for cancer diagnosis and clinical response prediction. Here we developed a robust HRD predictor HRD~CNA~ (Homologous recombination deficiency prediction by copy number alteration features) based on CNA features. HRD~CNA~ can precisely predict HR status across cancer types using CNA features data derived from different platforms and this study provides a robust tool for cost-effective HRD prediction and also demonstrates the applicability of CNA features in cancer precision medicine.
